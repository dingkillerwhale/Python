# Python

## pip installation

  * Download `get-pip.py` to a folder on your computer. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder containing `get-pip.py`. Then run `python get-pip.py`. This will install pip.
  
  In Windows Command Window,
  
  `cd C:\...\Python36` // where get-pip.py is
  
  `python get-pip.py`  // install pip
  
  * verify a successful installation by opening a command prompt window and navigating to your Python installation's script directory (default is `C:\Python36\Scripts`). Type `pip frezze` from this location to launch the Python interpreter.
  `pip frezze` displays the version number of all modules installed in your Python non-standard library.
